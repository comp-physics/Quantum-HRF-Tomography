### Summary

âš¡ **Fast**: Reduces required quantum circuits from exponential to linear in number of qubits  
ðŸŽ¯ **Accurate**: Achieves 89% fidelity on 10-qubit real states using IBM hardware  
ðŸ§  **Smart**: Uses random forest over hypercube graphs for efficient sign reconstruction  

### Introduction

### Install 

We recommend download all the files and finish the installation locally,

```bash
git clone https://github.com/comp-physics/Quantum-HRF-Tomography
cd Quantum-HRF-Tomography
pip install -e .
```

To visualize the tree structure, one need to install `Graphviz` to enforce the graph layout. For macOS,

```bash
brew install graphviz
pip install pygraphviz
```

Please refer to [here](https://www.graphviz.org/download/) for more instructions. Then one can use 

```python
import hadamard_random_forest as hrf
hrf.get_statevector(num_qubits, num_trees, samples, save_tree=True, show_tree=True)
```
