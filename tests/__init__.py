Test Suite for Hadamard Random Forest (HRF) Quantum State Tomography Library

This test module provides comprehensive testing for the HRF quantum state tomography library,
which implements efficient reconstruction of real-valued quantum states using random forests
over hypercube graphs. The library achieves exponential speedup (from O(4^n) to O(n) circuits)
compared to traditional quantum state tomography methods.

Test Module Structure
====================

The test suite is organized into three main modules, each testing different components
of the HRF library:

1. test_random_forest.py (52 tests across 7 test classes)
   - TestRandomForest: Core graph algorithms and spanning tree generation
   - TestParallelProcessing: Multiprocessing and batch tree generation
   - TestOptimizationFeatures: Caching mechanisms and pool management
   - TestCacheManagement: LRU cache eviction, statistics, and size management
   - TestSignDetermination: Mathematical correctness of sign algorithms
   - TestEdgeCases: Boundary conditions and error handling
   - TestTutorialWorkflow: Integration tests following tutorial notebooks
   
   Key features tested:
   - Uniform random tree generation using optimized algorithms
   - Majority voting and sign reconstruction mechanisms
   - Path finding and weight calculation functions
   - Reproducibility through random seed management
   - Parallel processing with configurable worker pools
   - LRU cache management with size limits and eviction policies
   - Cache statistics tracking (hits, misses, hit rates)

2. test_sample.py (35 tests)
   - Tests quantum circuit generation for Hadamard measurements
   - Validates sampling from both simulators and real quantum hardware
   - Tests M3 error mitigation integration with IBM Quantum backends
   - Covers statevector reconstruction from measurement data
   - Tests hardware-specific circuit transpilation and optimization

3. test_utils.py (25 tests)
   - Tests quantum entanglement measures (logarithmic negativity)
   - Validates quantum magic quantification (stabilizer entropy)
   - Tests quantum state overlap calculations (SWAP test)
   - Covers mathematical utilities for partial transpose and trace norm
   - Tests Pauli operator generation and conversion functions

Testing Methodology
===================

Unit Testing Framework:
- Built on Python's unittest framework with pytest integration
- Total of 112 tests covering ~98% of the codebase functionality
- Includes both unit tests and integration tests

Mock Testing Strategy:
- Extensive use of unittest.mock for quantum hardware operations
- Mocked IBM Quantum backends to avoid actual hardware calls during CI
- Simulated measurement results for deterministic testing

Reproducibility:
- Fixed random seeds (typically 42 or 999) for deterministic test results
- Controlled random state generation for quantum states and parameters
- Consistent test environments across different platforms

Test Coverage Areas:
- Algorithmic correctness of hypercube graph operations
- Quantum circuit construction and transpilation
- Hardware noise simulation and error mitigation
- Mathematical accuracy of quantum information measures
- Edge cases and error handling
- Parallel processing and multiprocessing validation
- Tutorial compliance and workflow integration
- Mathematical correctness against theoretical equations
- LRU cache management and memory optimization

Quality Assurance Features:
- Warning suppression for external library deprecations (mthree, Qiskit)
- Numerical stability testing with small floating-point values
- Input validation and error handling verification
- Performance testing for large qubit counts (up to 10 qubits)
- Memory management through LRU cache with configurable size limits
- Cache hit/miss ratio monitoring for performance optimization

Memory Management Features (tested in TestCacheManagement):
- LRU (Least Recently Used) cache implementation with OrderedDict
- Configurable cache size limits (default: hypercube=16, power2=100, hamming=20)
- Cache management API: clear_caches(), get_cache_info(), set_cache_sizes()
- Automatic eviction of least recently used items when cache is full
- Cache statistics tracking for performance monitoring
- Memory leak prevention in tree visualization code

Configuration and Execution
===========================

Test Configuration:
- pytest.ini configures warning filters for clean test output
- Suppresses DeprecationWarnings from mthree and Qiskit dependencies
- Maintains UserWarning and RuntimeWarning visibility for debugging

Running Tests:
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run with verbose output
pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test module
pytest tests/test_utils.py

# Run with coverage report
coverage run -m pytest tests/
coverage report

# Run tests for specific functionality
pytest tests/test_sample.py::TestQuantumSampling -v
```

Dependencies for Testing:
- Core: numpy, scipy, networkx, qiskit
- Testing: pytest, unittest.mock, coverage
- Quantum: qiskit-aer, qiskit-ibm-runtime, mthree
- Optional: pygraphviz (for tree visualization tests)

Integration with CI/CD:
- Automated testing on GitHub Actions
- Coverage reporting via coveralls
- Tests run on multiple Python versions and platforms
- Graphviz-dependent tests are conditionally skipped in CI environments

Test Data and Fixtures:
- Uses tutorial notebooks as behavioral references (especially 02a_hadamard_random_forest_simulation.ipynb)
- Includes known quantum states (Bell states, stabilizer states)
- Validates against theoretical predictions from quantum information theory
- Tests hardware noise models based on IBM Quantum device characteristics
- Validates Hadamard superposition principle from tutorial equation (2)
- Tests sign determination formula from tutorial equation (3)
- Includes tutorial default parameters (111 trees, seed 999)

This test suite ensures the reliability, accuracy, and performance of the HRF
quantum state tomography library across various quantum computing platforms
and use cases.
